# Aaron Nguyen

## Hello! 👋

I'm a senior studying Computer Science 💻 at [Florida International University 🐆](https://www.fiu.edu/). I'm interested in software engineering and distributed systems.


This summer, I'm working as a Software Engineer Intern at <img src="/assets/linkedin.svg" alt="LinkedIn" style="height:1em; width:auto; vertical-align:top;"> **LinkedIn** in Sunnyvale, CA!

Last summer, I was a Research Intern in Quantum Programming at [Microsoft 🌱](https://microsoft.com/) in Redmond, WA!

The spring before, I was a Software Engineer Intern at [NASA 🚀](https://www.nasa.gov/) in Huntsville, AL.
